The battleship project is a game being developed by me as a part of The Odin Project Curriculum. The main goal of this project is to improve my TDD skills.

Need to do:

- Let computer attack player
- Implement alert if player picks same attack coordinate twice

Note:

- Some tests were broken after learning better return states
- These methods now return much more helpful booleans, strings, etc.
